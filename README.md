### Version 1.0

1. **Introduction**
   We are making/developing a new innovative driving game where you try to make it to the finish line with the gas pedal stuck to the floor.  As an added challenge, you will only be able to control the car via input from your mouse, trackpad or touch-screen device.

2. **Prototype Objective**
   *Question* : Can the player make it to the goal with limited controls?
   We will be prototyping the game mechanics of constant acceleration along with the kinesthetics of controling the vehicle with the mouse to create a unique and challenging experience.
   We will be prototyping the game for PC, with mouse and trackpad support.

3. **Design Rationale**
   The game aims to be uniquely challenging and engaging with lots of potential replay ablility.
   It is an innovative game, putting a fresh twist on the traditional racing or driving games by limiting player control while also being in the experimental phase of prototyping whether or not it is a workable concept.
