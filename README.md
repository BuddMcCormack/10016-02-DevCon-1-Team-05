### Version 1.0

September 25, 2024

1. **Introduction**
   We are making/developing a new innovative driving game where you try to make it to the finish line with the gas pedal stuck to the floor.  As an added challenge, you will only be able to control the car via input from your mouse, trackpad or touch-screen device.

2. **Prototype Objective**
   *Question* : Can the player make it to the goal with limited controls?
   We will be prototyping the game mechanics of constant acceleration along with the kinesthetics of controling the vehicle with the mouse to create a unique and challenging experience.
   We will be prototyping the game for PC, with mouse and trackpad support.

3. **Gas Always On**   
   The player's car is constantly accelerating, which changes the standard racing game mechanics by forcing the player to focus solely on steering to avoid obstacles.

4. **Steering via Mouse/Trackpad/Touch Input**     
   Players control left and right steering using mouse or touch input. The kinesthetics of these controls will be the primary input system, creating a simple yet challenging gameplay loop.

5. **Obstacles**     
   The track will be littered with hazards that can damage the car or provide advantages:
     - **Damaging Obstacles**: Walls, roadblocks, and spikes that reduce player health.
     - **Advantageous Obstacles**: Boost pads or power-ups that temporarily increase player speed or grant invincibility.

6. **Bouncing Mechanic/Teleportation**     
   The player's car will be designed to bounce off walls rather than get stuck in them. If a player does get stuck, they will be teleported back to the middle of the track to ensure gameplay continuity.

7. **Objective Statement**  
   We aim to test whether players enjoy overcoming the challenge of restricted control mechanics, where acceleration is constant, and only steering is available. 

8. **Design Rationale**
   The game aims to be uniquely challenging and engaging with lots of potential replay ablility.
   It is an innovative game, putting a fresh twist on the traditional racing or driving games by limiting player control while also being in the experimental phase of prototyping whether or not it is a workable concept.
